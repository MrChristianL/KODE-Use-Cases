# KODE-Use-Cases

Allowing for a UI to sort, interact with, and determine use cases, this app uses FastAPI (python) for the backend, ReactJS for the front-end, and mongoDB as a database manager to sort through use cases. The goal is to be able to move forwards and backwards, either starting with the end result first and displaying which devices are necessary to get there, or to show which devices you have and what level of building automation is reachable with said devices.

TO-DO:
  - Button to add new use cases
  - Display at the top to track current choices (able to see what you have selected to make sure it's correct as you go)
  - A backup button to go to the step before
  - A start over button
  - A way to click options to maneuver through use cases
